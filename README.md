# unsys toolkit
An Interference & Entanglement Exploration Toolkit

# Installation

## Full Installation

You can install this package like this:

```shell
pip3 install git+dncolomer/_intent.git
```

Or you can clone this repository and run `pip3 install -e .` from inside the top level directory.

# The Basics

unsys is all about `StateSystems` and exploring their interference and entanglement properties. `StateSystems` are systems of quantum states and their correlations.

With unsys you can create `StateSystems` and study their entanlement by means of operating on the existing correlations. The following operations are available:

- `merging`: //wip
- `splitting`: //wip
- `composing`: //wip
- `decomposing`: //wip
- `simplifying`: //wip

unsys also provides you with tools to explore interference effects on `StateSystems`. unsys comes with a rewrite mechanism that is capable of evolving a `StateSystems` following the rules of quantum systems. This rewrite is designed to allow you to explore and design interference patterns and or to explore the intereference effects in existing quantum algorithms.
